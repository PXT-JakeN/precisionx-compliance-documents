## Standards

This directory contains mandatory control requirements that implement policies. Standards translate policy
into specific, testable requirements and reference the Procedures and Plans used to meet them.

Conventions
- Use YAML metadata at the top of each file (see templates).
- Include a Control Requirements table with Requirement ID, Description, Implementation, and Evidence.
- Reference applicable ISO/SOC/BCMS clauses where relevant.
- Maintain additive Revision History and bump version/effective_date when requirements change.

See template: ../templates/_TEMPLATE-Standard.md

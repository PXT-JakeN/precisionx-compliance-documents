## 1. Purpose

Specify scanning coverage, cadence, methods, and evidencing for infrastructure, endpoints, containers, and
applications to identify and reduce technical vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

Servers, workstations, containers/images, cloud configurations, and internet‑facing assets.

## 3. Control Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Implementation | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| VUL-01 | Authenticated host scans | Weekly authenticated scans of servers; monthly for workstations | Scan schedules; results |
| VUL-02 | External perimeter | Monthly unauthenticated scans of public assets; trigger on changes | Reports; tickets |
| VUL-03 | Containers/images | Scan images on build and regularly in registry; block criticals from deploy | Pipeline logs; registry reports |
| VUL-04 | App scanning | DAST on major releases/quarterly; integrate with CI/CD | DAST reports; pipeline gates |
| VUL-05 | SCA/SAST | Run on commits/PRs with thresholds; break builds on criticals | CI reports |
| VUL-06 | Cloud config | Periodic checks for misconfigurations (CSPM‑like); exceptions documented | Findings; exceptions |
| VUL-07 | Evidence & SIEM | Centralize results; if tool cannot integrate, retain exports/screenshots | SIEM dashboards; exports |
| VUL-08 | SLA linkage | Map severities to remediation SLAs (see policy); track to closure | Ticketing; dashboards |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

SecOps operates scanning platforms and triage; Engineering owns fixes; GRC tracks SLAs and reporting.

## 1. Purpose

Define consistent severity ratings and remediation timelines for vulnerabilities, including exception handling
and evidencing.

## 2. Scope

All vulnerabilities identified in servers, workstations, applications, containers, cloud configurations, and third‑party
software used by GridSite.

## 3. Severity and SLAs

Severity is determined by CVSS base score adjusted by business context (exposure, exploitability, data
sensitivity, and presence of compensating controls). Default SLAs:

| Severity | Examples | Target Remediation SLA |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Critical | CVSS ≥ 9.0; active exploitation; internet‑facing RCE | 7 days (hotfix ASAP) |
| High | CVSS 7.0–8.9; privilege escalation; sensitive data exposure | 30 days |
| Medium | CVSS 4.0–6.9; limited impact or mitigations in place | 90 days |
| Low | CVSS < 4.0; cosmetic or informational | 180 days |

Compensating controls may justify temporary extensions with documented risk acceptance by Executive
Management for Critical/High and by the ISMS Manager for Medium/Low. Internet‑facing Critical issues require
immediate mitigation and 24/7 tracking until resolved.

## 4. Tracking and Evidence

All findings are tracked to closure with owner, severity rationale, due date, and evidence of remediation or
risk acceptance. Dashboards report SLA attainment. Where tools cannot integrate with SIEM, exports or
screenshots are retained.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

SecOps triages and validates severity; Engineering/IT remediate; GRC tracks SLA compliance and exceptions.

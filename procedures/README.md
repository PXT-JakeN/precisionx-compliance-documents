## Procedures

This directory contains operational step-by-step procedures. Procedures support the Standards and should be
actionable for practitioners.

Conventions
- Use YAML metadata at the top (see templates).
- Use ordered lists for procedural steps; include inputs, prerequisites, expected outputs, and evidence.
- Link to related Standards and Plans.
- Maintain additive Revision History and update version/effective_date for substantive changes.

See template: ../templates/_TEMPLATE-Procedure.md

   as flagged by portal; background checks required for vendor/maintenance roles before unescorted access.
4. Escort: Host authenticates at kiosk, declares up to five visitors, and accepts escort responsibility.
5. Badge Issuance: Temporary badge activated for interior areas per role; exterior doors remain disabled until
   sign‑in completes; access auto‑revokes at sign‑out.

   credential; lost badges are deactivated and replacement ordered.

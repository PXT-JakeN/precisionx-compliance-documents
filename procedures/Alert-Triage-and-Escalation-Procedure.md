Standardize alert intake, triage, and escalation to ensure timely response and consistent documentation.

## 2. Scope

All security alerts generated by SIEM and monitoring platforms; includes manual review outputs for sources
that cannot integrate.

- On‑call schedule and paging integrated with SIEM
- Severity definitions and mapping to incident classification

1. Intake
   - Alerts routed to on‑call with severity; open ticket; attach raw events or manual review evidence.
2. Triage
   - Validate signal, enrich with context, determine scope/impact, and classify (benign, P1–P4 candidate).
3. Escalation
   - Page appropriate SMEs; invoke IR process for incident candidates; add stakeholders to NOC AV link when
     broader awareness is required.
4. Containment Recommendations
   - Provide immediate actions (block, disable, isolate); coordinate with system owners.
5. Documentation
   - Record steps, decisions, artifacts, and timelines; link to related alerts/incidents.

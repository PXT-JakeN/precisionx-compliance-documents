## 1. Purpose

Define how GridSite measures security and continuity performance and drives continuous improvement across the
ISMS/BCMS.

## 2. Scope

All controls, processes, and services in ISMS scope, including SaaS, GridColo, and corporate operations.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite maintains measurable objectives with targets documented in the ISMS Objectives Register. Key risk and
performance indicators are defined, collected, and reviewed on a defined cadence by control owners; exceptions
and adverse trends trigger corrective and preventative actions (CAPA). Metrics include, as appropriate: incident
MTTD/MTTR, backup success and restore times, vulnerability SLA adherence, change success rates, access review
closure, DLP events, capacity SLOs, and training completion. Evidence is retained; where systems cannot
forward metrics or logs, periodic manual export and review are performed. Management reviews evaluate
effectiveness and approve improvements; significant changes are tracked to completion.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with alternate measurement and remediation plans.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via dashboard coverage, review minutes, CAPA closure rates, and audit sampling.

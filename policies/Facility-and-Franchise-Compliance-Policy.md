## 1. Purpose

Define mandatory compliance requirements for corporate offices, NOCs, GridColo facilities, and Powered by
GridSite franchise locations to ensure uniform security and operational standards.

## 2. Scope

All GridSite‑controlled or licensed facilities and all franchisee‑operated sites under the Powered by GridSite
and GridColo Inside programs.

## 3. Policy Statements

Facilities and franchise sites shall implement the Facility Physical Security Standard, NOC Build Standard where
applicable, and DCIM/telemetry requirements. The integrated access portal and kiosk program (3‑factor badge,
face, PIN) with enrollment, background checks for vendor/facilities roles, escort limits, guard terminal fallback,
and auditable logs applies at all sites. Franchisees must adopt the Franchise Technical Baseline and maintain
evidence of control operation (access logs, CCTV coverage, maintenance records, incident logs). Deviations
require approved exceptions with compensating controls and timelines. GridSite conducts readiness reviews,
periodic audits, and surge support exercises; non‑conformities are tracked to closure. Records are retained per
policy; where tooling cannot forward logs, periodic manual export and review are performed.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Facilities and ISMS approval with time‑bound remediation plans.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via site audit results, evidence sampling, telemetry coverage, and corrective action closure.

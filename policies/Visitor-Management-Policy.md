## 1. Purpose

Define requirements for pre‑registration, identity verification, sign‑in, escorting, and logging of visitors.

## 2. Scope

All offices, NOCs, and GridColo facilities.

## 3. Policy Statements

Visitors must be pre‑registered or registered at arrival, present identification when required, and sign in using
the kiosk or guard terminal. Escorts must declare visitors and remain with them; each escort may accompany
no more than five visitors. Visitor badges grant lobby access only until sign‑in; further access is time‑bound
and revoked at sign‑out. Visitor records and access events are retained and auditable.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Facilities approval.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via sampling of visitor logs and access events.

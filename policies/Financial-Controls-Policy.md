## 1. Purpose

Establish internal control principles over financial reporting (ICFR) to ensure accurate, complete, and timely
financial records and disclosures.

## 2. Scope

Financial systems, records, and processes affecting revenue, billing, cash, payables/receivables, and the general
ledger, including supporting IT systems.

## 3. Policy Statements

Segregation of duties is enforced across initiation, authorization, custody, and recording activities. Access to
financial systems follows least privilege with periodic reviews; administrative access requires MFA and session
logging. Standardized reconciliations are performed and reviewed; exceptions and adjustments require
independent approval and documented rationale. Changes to financial systems follow change control with testing
and rollback. Source data integrity is protected via validated interfaces; manual entries are limited and approved.
Evidence of approvals, reconciliations, and reviews is retained per retention schedules. Where systems cannot
forward audit trails, periodic manual export and review are required. Exceptions follow the Exception &
Compensating Controls Policy.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Finance Lead and ISMS approval, with compensating controls and an expiry date.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via reconciliation timeliness/accuracy, exception aging, access review results, and audit findings.

## 1. Purpose

Establish governance for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities through scanning,
patching, and configuration updates with defined SLAs and evidencing.

## 2. Scope

Servers, workstations, applications, containers, cloud control planes, and third‑party software. Includes
development pipelines for build‑time remediation.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

SecOps operates scanning and triage; Engineering/IT remediate per SLAs; GRC tracks SLA compliance and
exceptions; System Owners approve and schedule changes.

## 4. Policy Statements

GridSite maintains vulnerability scanning platforms and CI checks consistent with the Vulnerability Scanning
Standard. Findings are assigned severities per the Severity & SLA Standard and are tracked to closure.
Remediation may include patching, configuration changes, or compensating controls when remediation is not
immediately feasible. Emergency patches for actively exploited issues are prioritized ahead of change windows
with expedited approvals per Change Control. Evidence of remediation includes patch reports, configuration
diffs, and test results. Where tooling cannot integrate with SIEM, exported reports or screenshots are retained.

## 5. Exceptions

Risk acceptance requires documented business justification, defined compensating controls, and approval per
the Severity & SLA Standard.

## 6. Compliance Measurement

Compliance is measured via SLA attainment dashboards, audit sampling of changes, and repeated‑finding
metrics.

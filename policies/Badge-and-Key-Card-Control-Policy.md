## 1. Purpose

Define issuance, use, and revocation requirements for badges, keys, and access cards controlling GridSite
facilities, cages, and equipment.

## 2. Scope

All personnel, vendors, tenants, and visitors who require physical access to GridSite‑controlled locations.

## 3. Policy Statements

All cardholders must enroll via the access portal with identity verification; vendor/facility roles require background
checks before unescorted access. Badges grant exterior‑to‑lobby entry only until kiosk sign‑in; interior access is
enabled post sign‑in and revoked at sign‑out. Guards can provision access via terminal when the kiosk is
unavailable, with face match and PIN. Lost badges are deactivated immediately; temporary credentials may be
issued after ID verification. Key and card privileges reflect least privilege and are reviewed regularly. Escorts may
sign in up to five visitors and accept responsibility at the kiosk. All access and administrative actions are logged;
when forwarding is not possible, periodic manual export and review are performed.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Facilities approval with documented compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via access audit sampling, badge inventory reconciliation, and exception tracking.

## 1. Purpose

Define the quality and document control practices for creating, approving, publishing, revising, and retiring
ISMS/BCMS documents.

## 2. Scope

All policies, standards, procedures, plans, and records within the repository.

## 3. Policy Statements

Documents include YAML metadata and a Document Control section; substantive changes update version and
effective date and include a revision history line. Drafts require owner and approver identification before
publication. Links are relative and cross‑referenced rather than duplicated. Reviews occur at least annually or
upon significant change. Superseded documents are archived with read‑only access. Quality checks ensure
clear language, consistent structure, and traceability to standards and procedures.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval and documented rationale.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via periodic audits of document metadata and revision histories.

## 6. Revision History

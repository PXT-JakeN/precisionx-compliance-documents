## 1. Purpose

Define personnel‑related security requirements across hiring, employment, and termination to protect GridSite
assets and customer information.

## 2. Scope

All employees and contractors, including franchise staff and facility personnel.

## 3. Policy Statements

Pre‑employment screening is performed commensurate with role and applicable law; confidentiality agreements are
executed prior to access. Onboarding follows the JML process with timely provisioning and training on policies,
data classification, and acceptable use. Access is reviewed on role changes; privileged access requires additional
training and approvals. Offboarding revokes logical and physical access promptly; assets and credentials are
recovered and accounts disabled. Remote work follows the Remote Work Security Policy; BYOD limits apply per
classification labels. Facility staff and vendors requiring site access must complete enrollment and background
checks per Facility Physical Security Standard before unescorted access. Violations may result in disciplinary
action up to termination.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require HR and ISMS approval with documented compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via onboarding/offboarding SLA, access review results, and training completion.

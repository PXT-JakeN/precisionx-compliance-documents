## 1. Purpose

Establish a framework to identify, interpret, implement, monitor, and evidence compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contractual obligations, and customer commitments.

## 2. Scope

All GridSite operations including SaaS platforms, GridColo facilities, corporate functions, and Powered by GridSite
programs, and their subservice organizations.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite maintains an obligations register mapping legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements to ISMS/BCMS
controls, owners, and evidence. New obligations are assessed during product, market, or vendor onboarding;
contracts include security, privacy, residency, and audit clauses. Compliance is operationalized via policies,
standards, and procedures; exceptions are governed by the Exception & Compensating Controls Policy. Evidence is
retained per Records Management. Monitoring includes internal audits, supplier assessments, and certification
activities (ISO 27001/22301; SOC 1/2). Where systems cannot forward compliance logs or artifacts, periodic manual
exports and reviews are performed. Non‑compliance is escalated with corrective actions tracked to closure.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Legal and ISMS approval with documented risk treatment and expiry.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via audit results, obligation register coverage, evidence completeness, and CAPA closure rates.

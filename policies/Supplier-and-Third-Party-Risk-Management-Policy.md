## 1. Purpose

Define requirements to assess, onboard, monitor, and offboard suppliers and subservice organizations.

## 2. Scope

All third parties that process, store, or transmit GridSite information or support services.

## 3. Policy Statements

Suppliers are risk‑tiered and undergo due diligence proportional to risk, including security questionnaires,
evidence review (e.g., SOC reports), and contractual requirements (confidentiality, breach notice, data
handling). Subservice organizations are monitored for control changes; gaps and CUECs are documented with
mitigations. Access is limited to least privilege and removed at termination. Annual reassessments and
triggered reviews are conducted upon incidents or material changes.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require risk acceptance and defined compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via completion of due diligence packages, monitoring activities, and reassessment cadence.

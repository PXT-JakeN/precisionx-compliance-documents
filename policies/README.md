## Policies

This directory contains GridSite’s top-level governance policies. Policies set intent and authority and are
prescriptive in nature. Policies should be concise, standards-aligned, and reference relevant Standards,
Procedures, and Plans rather than duplicating their content.

Conventions
- Use YAML metadata at the top of each file (see templates).
- Maintain standard sections: Purpose, Scope, Roles and Responsibilities, Policy Statements, Exceptions,
  Compliance Measurement, Enforcement, Revision History.
- Link to supporting documents with relative paths (e.g., ../standards/Access-Control-Standard.md).
- Update version and effective_date upon substantive changes; maintain additive Revision History table.

See template: ../templates/_TEMPLATE-Policy.md

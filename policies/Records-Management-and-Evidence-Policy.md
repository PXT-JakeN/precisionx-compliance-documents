## 1. Purpose

Define requirements to create, retain, protect, and retrieve records as evidence of control operation and
compliance.

## 2. Scope

All ISMS/BCMS and operational records, including logs, tickets, approvals, reports, training, exercises, and
audit artifacts.

## 3. Policy Statements

Records must be accurate, complete, time‑synchronized where applicable, and retrievable within reasonable
time. Storage locations and retention are defined per the Data Retention & Disposal Policy and classification.
Evidence of controls (e.g., access reviews, change approvals, backup tests) is stored with sufficient context to
support audits. Where tooling cannot integrate, screenshots or exports are retained. Access to records
follows least privilege and is auditable. Litigation or audit holds suspend disposal until cleared.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via sampling for completeness and timeliness and verification of holds and disposal records.

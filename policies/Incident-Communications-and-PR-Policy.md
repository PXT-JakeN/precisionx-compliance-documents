## 1. Purpose

Define principles and responsibilities for internal and external communications during security or service
incidents to ensure accuracy, timeliness, and compliance.

## 2. Scope

All incidents impacting GridSite services, facilities, customers, personnel, or regulated data.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite coordinates communications through designated spokespersons per the Crisis Communications Plan.
Statements must be fact‑based, approved by Communications and Legal, and aligned to contractual and
regulatory notification requirements. Customer notifications are coordinated with the incident owner and Account
Management; confidential or RESTRICTED information is shared on a need‑to‑know basis. Public channels (web,
status page, social) are used when appropriate; messaging is archived as evidence. Media inquiries are routed to
Communications. Where tooling cannot forward communication logs or posts, periodic manual export and review
are performed. Post‑incident reviews capture communications lessons and improvements.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Communications and Legal approval.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via notification timeliness, accuracy, and adherence to plan approvals.

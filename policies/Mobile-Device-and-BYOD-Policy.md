## 1. Purpose

Establish requirements for secure use of mobile devices and personal (BYOD) equipment while protecting GridSite
information and services.

## 2. Scope

All employees, contractors, vendors, and franchise personnel using smartphones, tablets, or laptops to access
GridSite information or services, whether company‑owned or personal.

## 3. Policy Statements

Company‑owned devices must be configured and managed per the Workstation Baseline and Endpoint Security
Policy, including encryption, screen‑lock, patching, EDR, and DLP. Personal BYOD devices are limited to
accessing PUBLIC and CONFIDENTIAL information only; INTERNAL and RESTRICTED information shall be accessed
and processed solely on company‑approved and managed systems. Access to Microsoft 365 or other SaaS shall
use SSO/MFA with Microsoft 365 as identity provider where supported. Local storage of company data on BYOD
devices shall be minimized; users must not bypass DLP or copy company data to personal clouds. Lost or stolen
devices must be reported immediately for access revocation and evidence capture. Email auto‑forwarding to
personal accounts is prohibited. Logging for communications and access is enabled where technically feasible;
systems that cannot forward logs require periodic manual review and export.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with documented compensating controls aligned to data classification.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via enrollment/compliance reports, DLP events, and incident records.

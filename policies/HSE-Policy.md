All personnel, contractors, visitors, and activities at GridSite‑controlled locations.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite complies with applicable EHS laws and maintains a safe workplace through hazard identification, risk
assessment, and control implementation. Personnel receive role‑appropriate safety training and required PPE.
Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) is mandatory for maintenance activities per standard and procedure. Incidents and near
misses are reported promptly, investigated, and corrective actions tracked to closure. Emergency preparedness
and response plans are maintained and exercised. Environmental controls and waste handling follow regulations.
Records of training, incidents, inspections, and maintenance are retained; where systems cannot forward logs,
periodic manual export and review are performed.

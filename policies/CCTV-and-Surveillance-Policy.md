## 1. Purpose

Define requirements for video surveillance to deter and investigate security incidents while respecting legal and
privacy obligations.

## 2. Scope

All corporate offices, NOCs, GridColo facilities, and franchise sites using GridSite‑approved surveillance systems.

## 3. Policy Statements

CCTV covers perimeter entries, lobbies, mantraps, critical rooms, cages, and loading docks; coverage gaps are
assessed and addressed. Recording retention and access controls follow the Facility Physical Security Standard;
live feeds are available to NOC with resilient audio/video links for surge coordination. Exports for investigations
use the CCTV Export & Review Procedure with chain‑of‑custody. Kiosk/portal and guard terminals integrate with
event logs. Signage is posted where required; audio recording is restricted to legal allowances. All access and
exports are logged; when forwarding is not available, periodic manual export and review are performed.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Facilities and Legal approval with documented justification.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via retention audits, access log sampling, and incident case reviews.

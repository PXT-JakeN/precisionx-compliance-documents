## 1. Purpose

Define controls to ensure revenue is recognized appropriately and billing is accurate, authorized, and timely.

## 2. Scope

Customer contracts, pricing, invoicing, credit/adjustments, revenue schedules, and related ledger postings.

## 3. Policy Statements

Customer contracts and pricing require appropriate authorization; terms impacting revenue are reviewed for
consistency. Billing is generated from authoritative sources; changes and credits require documented approval.
Revenue schedules are maintained per contract obligations and recognized only when criteria are met.
Reconciliations between billing, payments, and the general ledger are performed and independently reviewed.
Access to billing and revenue systems is role‑based with periodic reviews; changes to configurations follow
change control. Evidence and audit trails are retained; when systems cannot forward logs, periodic manual
export and review are performed.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Finance Lead approval, documented rationale, and compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via reconciliation breaks, credit/adjustment approvals, and audit sampling results.

## 1. Purpose

Define how deviations from policies/standards are evaluated, approved, documented, monitored, and retired using
risk‑based decisions and compensating controls.

## 2. Scope

All ISMS and BCMS documents and the controls they mandate across corporate, SaaS, and GridColo contexts.

## 3. Policy Statements

Exceptions must include: description, affected controls, risk analysis, proposed compensating controls, owner,
expiry date, and monitoring plan. Approvals require role‑appropriate authority (control owner and ISMS at
minimum), with executive approval for high risk or extended durations. Compensating controls shall reduce risk to
an acceptable level; examples include enhanced logging with independent review, additional approvals, temporary
network isolation, or accelerated rotation. Exceptions are time‑bound, reviewed at least quarterly, and either
remediated or renewed with fresh analysis. Exceptions impacting ISO Annex A controls are reflected in the SoA.
Evidence (tickets, approvals, monitoring results) is retained; where tooling cannot forward data, periodic manual
exports and review are required.

## 4. Exceptions

This section intentionally reserved; the process above governs granting exceptions.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via exception register, renewal rates, overdue exceptions, and risk reduction evidence.

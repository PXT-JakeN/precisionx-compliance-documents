## 1. Purpose

Establish policy for protecting facilities, equipment, and personnel against physical and environmental risks.

## 2. Scope

Corporate offices, NOCs, GridColo sites, and any licensed facilities.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite implements layered physical security (perimeter, entry, secure areas) with badge access, visitor
management, CCTV, and environmental monitoring. Access roles are defined in the integrated portal; kiosk
and guard terminal processes enforce identity verification as described in the Facility Physical Security
Standard. Environmental controls include power redundancy, UPS, and fire detection/suppression. Changes to
facility systems follow the Maintenance & MEP Change Standard and EHS/LOTO requirements. All physical
security and environmental events are logged and retained for audit.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require Facilities and ISMS approval.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via site inspections, access log sampling, and test records.

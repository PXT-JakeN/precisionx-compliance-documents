## 1. Purpose

Define governance for identifying, recording, classifying, and managing information assets throughout their
lifecycle.

## 2. Scope

All hardware, software, services, datasets, and credentials used by GridSite.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite maintains an Asset Inventory & CMDB that records ownership, classification, location, lifecycle state,
and dependencies. Company‑owned endpoints and servers comply with baseline standards; cloud assets are
tracked by account and tag. Asset Owners are responsible for accurate records and periodic verification; they
approve access and disposal. Decommissioning follows secure data disposition per the Data Retention &
Disposal Policy. High‑value assets require enhanced logging or manual reviews where integrations are not
available. Periodic reconciliation against procurement and identity systems is performed.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require risk assessment, approvals, and compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via inventory accuracy, reconciliation results, and sampling of decommissioning records.

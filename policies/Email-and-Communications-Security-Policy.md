## 1. Purpose

Define secure use of email, messaging, conferencing, and file sharing to protect GridSite information.

## 2. Scope

All personnel using Microsoft 365 and approved communications platforms.

## 3. Policy Statements

Users must apply sensitivity labels and handle data per classification. External sharing requires a valid
business need and NDA when applicable. Anti‑phishing and malware defenses must remain enabled; suspicious
messages are reported via the phishing button. Encryption (M365 native or S/MIME) must be used for
RESTRICTED content; PUBLIC marketing content is exempt. BYOD access is limited to PUBLIC and CONFIDENTIAL
information. Auto‑forwarding to personal accounts is prohibited. Logging of email security events is enabled;
systems lacking forwarding require periodic manual review and export.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via DLP events, audit logs, and training results.

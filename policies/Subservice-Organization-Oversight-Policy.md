## 1. Purpose

Define governance for selection, onboarding, and continuous oversight of subservice organizations supporting
GridSite services and included in SOC/ISO control boundaries.

## 2. Scope

All subservice organizations that process, store, or transmit GridSite or customer data, or that materially support
control objectives.

## 3. Policy Statements

Subservice organizations shall be risk‑tiered during onboarding and subject to due diligence commensurate with
impact. Contracts shall require security obligations, timely notification of incidents, and provision of SOC/ISO
reports. SOC 1/2 reports (or equivalents) are obtained annually with bridge letters covering gaps; complementary
user entity controls (CUECs) are mapped to GridSite controls. Findings and carve‑outs are evaluated, with
remediation tracked to closure or compensating controls documented. Ongoing monitoring includes KPI/KRI
reviews, SLAs, support tickets, and security advisories. Offboarding includes data return/destruction and access
revocation, with evidence retained.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with documented risk treatment.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via evidence of report collection, CUEC mapping, remediation tracking, and annual review records.

## 1. Purpose

Define retention periods and secure disposal requirements for information in alignment with classification,
legal, contractual, and operational needs.

## 2. Scope

All records and data sets under GridSite control, including backups and exported evidence.

## 3. Policy Statements

Retention schedules are defined by data category and label; when law or contract prescribes longer retention,
those requirements prevail. Backups inherit applicable retention and must be disposed of securely after
expiry. Disposal uses methods appropriate to medium and label (e.g., cryptographic erase for disks, secure
deletion for files, certificate revocation for keys); records of disposal are retained. Holds for litigation or audit
override normal schedules and are documented. Automation is used where feasible; otherwise, manual
disposal processes are executed with evidence capture.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require legal/compliance review and documented approvals.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via periodic sampling of storage systems, backup repositories, and disposal records.

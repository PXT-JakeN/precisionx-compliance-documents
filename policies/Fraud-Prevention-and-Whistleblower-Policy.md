## 1. Purpose

Prevent, detect, and respond to fraud and misconduct and provide protected channels for reporting concerns
without fear of retaliation.

## 2. Scope

All GridSite personnel, contractors, vendors, and franchise staff.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite maintains an ethics program with training, clear standards of conduct, and defined reporting channels
for suspected fraud, waste, or abuse. Reports may be made confidentially or anonymously; retaliation against
good‑faith reporters is prohibited. Allegations are triaged and investigated by designated personnel with
appropriate separation from implicated functions. Evidence is preserved; privacy and legal considerations are
respected. Confirmed issues result in corrective and disciplinary actions and control improvements. Communications
are coordinated with Legal and, when required, customers or authorities. Records of reports and outcomes are
retained; when tooling cannot forward artifacts, periodic manual export and review are performed.

## 4. Exceptions

None; deviations require executive approval and legal review.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via training completion, case handling timeliness, and corrective action closure rates.

## 1. Purpose

Set principles for lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data and define responsibilities for
protecting data subject rights.

## 2. Scope

All personal data processed by GridSite in any system or medium.

## 3. Policy Statements

GridSite processes personal data for specified purposes, limits collection to what is necessary, and implements
appropriate security and retention controls. Data inventories are maintained with categories, purposes,
recipients, and retention. Access to personal data is limited by role and classification; BYOD is restricted to
PUBLIC/CONFIDENTIAL content per classification policy. Requests from data subjects (access, correction,
deletion) are logged and fulfilled within required timeframes. Personal data transfers to third parties require
contracts and assurances. Breach notification is performed in accordance with legal and contractual
obligations.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require legal review and risk assessment.

## 1. Purpose

Define requirements for labeling, protecting, transporting, and disposing of information on physical and
removable media.

## 2. Scope

All physical records and removable media (USB drives, external disks, tapes, portable devices) that may store
GridSite information.

## 3. Policy Statements

Use of removable media for RESTRICTED and INTERNAL data is prohibited unless explicitly approved with
encryption and tracking; PUBLIC and CONFIDENTIAL use must follow data labeling and DLP rules. Devices must be
encrypted and malware‑scanned before use; copying customer data to personal media is prohibited. Media in
transit is protected against tampering and loss with sealed containers or couriers as appropriate. Media reuse
and disposal employ approved data erasure or destruction with certificates retained. Where systems cannot
forward device usage logs, periodic manual export and review are performed. Handling aligns to Records
Management for retention and legal hold.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with compensating controls and defined duration.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via DLP events, device control reports, and destruction certificates.

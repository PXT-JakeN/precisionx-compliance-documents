## 1. Purpose

Reduce unauthorized access and disclosure by ensuring work areas and devices are secured when unattended and
information is properly stored.

## 2. Scope

All GridSite locations and remote work areas where GridSite information is accessed or stored.

## 3. Policy Statements

Printed materials and removable media containing INTERNAL or RESTRICTED information must be secured in
locked storage when unattended; shredding or secure bins are used for disposal. Devices must auto‑lock with
short timeouts and require MFA where applicable; displays are positioned to minimize shoulder surfing. Whiteboards
and collaboration surfaces are cleared after use; photos of RESTRICTED information are prohibited on personal
devices. Clean desk checks are performed periodically at offices and NOCs. For remote work, users maintain a
private area, avoid shared accounts, and follow BYOD limits. Where facilities rely on guard fallbacks, paper logs
are secured and disposed per Records Management.

## 4. Exceptions

Exceptions require ISMS approval with defined duration and compensating controls.

## 5. Compliance Measurement

Measured via site inspections, endpoint configuration reports, and disposal certificate sampling.

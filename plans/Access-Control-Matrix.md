## 1. Purpose

Define and maintain system‑to‑role‑to‑privilege mappings, segregation of duties constraints, and review cadences.

## 2. Structure

For each system/application: list roles, entitlements (CRUD/admin), scope limits (tenant/env), SoD rules (e.g., no
developer direct access to prod DBs), MFA requirements, session recording for privileged access, and approval workflow.

## 3. Review and Evidence

Quarterly user access reviews by owners; semiannual privileged access reviews per S06/P10; record exceptions and
compensating controls; export review evidence when systems cannot forward.

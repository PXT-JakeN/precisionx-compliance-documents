## 1. Purpose

Define how GridSite coordinates internal and external communications during crises to ensure accuracy, timeliness, and
regulatory compliance while protecting customers and brand.

## 2. Triggers and Interfaces

This plan activates upon declaration of a major incident or crisis by the Incident Commander (per IR Policy) or the
Crisis Manager (per Crisis Management Plan). It interfaces with the IR runbooks, BCMS strategies, and legal and PR
workstreams.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

Communications Lead (owner) drafts and routes statements; Legal Counsel reviews regulatory and contractual language;
Executive Sponsor approves public statements; ISMS Manager validates technical accuracy; NOC maintains the 24x7 Teams
bridge, radio/SIP alerts, and status reporting; Customer Success coordinates with affected customers.

## 4. Channels and Artifacts

Primary: Microsoft 365 Teams bridge, approved email lists, corporate website/status page, and press/analyst channels.
Maintain a live AV link between primary and secondary NOCs to synchronize situational updates and enable surge
participation. Capture records (drafts, approvals, releases, web updates) in the evidence repository; export manually
if systems cannot forward artifacts.

## 5. Process

1. Initiation: Open a comms workstream tied to the incident record; confirm roles and cadence.
2. Stakeholder Mapping: Identify internal/external stakeholders (employees, customers, partners, regulators, media) and
   define tailored messages and SLAs.
3. Message Development: Prepare holding statements, FAQs, and updates with clear facts, impact, actions taken, and
   next steps; avoid speculation.
4. Review and Approval: Legal and Executive review required prior to external distribution; retain tracked changes.
5. Distribution and Monitoring: Publish to selected channels; monitor responses and misinformation; coordinate updates
   at defined intervals.
6. Closure and Lessons: Issue closure statement; collect metrics and lessons learned; archive artifacts.

## 6. Metrics

Time to first statement, update cadence adherence, approval turnaround, stakeholder satisfaction, media accuracy rate.

## 1. Purpose

Define how GridSite coordinates enterprise‑level response to crises that exceed routine incident management, ensuring
continuity of critical services and decision‑making.

## 2. Governance and Structure

Establish a Crisis Management Team (CMT) with an Executive Sponsor, Crisis Manager (chair), Operations, Security,
Facilities, Legal, HR, Customer, and Communications leads. The CMT integrates with dual‑NOC operations via a live AV
bridge and maintains a common operating picture.

## 3. Activation and Operations

Criteria include multi‑region outages, major breaches, safety events, or material regulatory exposure. Upon activation,
open a crisis record; set objectives and operational periods; coordinate workstreams (technical response, facilities,
customer, legal/comms); and manage resource allocation and external coordination.

## 4. Decision Logging and Documentation

Record decisions, rationale, and approvals; maintain action trackers; store artifacts in evidence repository; export
manually where forwarding is unavailable.

## 5. Demobilization and Recovery

Transition to recovery and steady state; conduct post‑crisis reviews; feed improvements into BCMS strategy, IR playbooks,
and management reviews.

## 1. Purpose

Define the structure and cadence for Business Impact Analysis (BIA) reports for each critical function.

## 2. Report Structure

Each BIA shall include: function overview; stakeholders; inputs/outputs; upstream/downstream dependencies; maximum
tolerable downtime (MTD), recovery time (RTO), recovery point (RPO); impacts over time (financial, legal, customer,
operational); required resources (people, facilities, cloud platforms, NOC, third‑parties); workarounds; and data
classification considerations.

## 3. Method & Sources

Use PR03 to conduct interviews and workshops; leverage CMDB/asset inventory, capacity/availability reports, vendor
registers, and incident history. Align classifications to P06 and privacy to P31.

## 4. Cadence & Maintenance

Produce initial BIAs during Day 61–90; review annually or on significant change (org, process, system, vendor).

## 5. Evidence & Metrics

Store signed BIA reports and supporting extracts; if forwarding is unavailable, export artifacts and archive. Metrics:
coverage of critical functions, on‑time updates, and variance between planned vs. observed RTO/RPO in exercises.

## Plans

This directory contains implementation and testing plans (e.g., Business Continuity, Incident Response,
Disaster Recovery, Exercise/Testing Plans). Plans describe objectives, roles, processes, and exercise
approaches.

Conventions
- Use YAML metadata at the top (see templates).
- Include objectives, scope, triggers, roles and responsibilities, resources, procedures, testing/exercise
  schedules, maintenance, and evidence.
- Maintain additive Revision History and update version/effective_date as needed.

See template: ../templates/_TEMPLATE-Plan.md

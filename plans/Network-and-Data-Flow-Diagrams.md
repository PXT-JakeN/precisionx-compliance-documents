## 1. Purpose & Scope

Define and maintain canonical network and data flow diagrams per system to support security design, audits, and
operations.

## 2. Diagram Requirements

Show zones (management/control/data/guest), admin ingress (NOC‑restricted), external interfaces (WAF, APIs), data
stores, encryption boundaries, and logging paths. Label protocols/ports and trust boundaries.

## 3. Maintenance & Storage

Version diagrams with change control; store source and exports in evidence repository; where diagramming tools cannot
forward artifacts, export and archive manually.

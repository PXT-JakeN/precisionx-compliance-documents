## 1. Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- Your work email address
- An invitation email from PrecisionX (check your inbox)
- About 10 minutes to complete setup

### Step 1: Accept Your Invitation

1. Check your email for an invitation from Bitwarden
2. Click **Join Organization** in the email
3. This will take you to the Bitwarden signup page

### Step 2: Create Your Account

1. Enter your **work email address**
2. Create a **Master Password** - this is the ONE password you need to remember

#### Master Password Requirements

Your master password should be:
- At least **12 characters** long
- Something you can remember but others can't guess
- **NOT** a password you use anywhere else

**Tip:** Use a passphrase - a series of random words. For example:
- `correct-horse-battery-staple`
- `purple-mountain-coffee-tuesday`
- `keyboard-sunshine-pizza-rocket42`

3. Re-enter your master password to confirm
4. Click **Create Account**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** If you forget your master password, IT cannot recover it for you. Bitwarden uses zero-knowledge encryption, which means only YOU know your master password. Write it down and store it somewhere safe at home.
